      * Manual or powered

      * Flexible and simple track mounting system

      * Standard components to connect and suspend the monorail conveyor track

      * All components are electro galvanized for complete protection

      * Seamless integration with the NikoTrack lightweight crane and lifting
      equipment

      * Free running, economical with minimal maintenance


      ## SUITABLE FOR


      * Powder coating, painting, and material finishing applications

      * Any industrial process that requires movement of parts, above floor
      level

      * Situations where flightbars are used to move parts between processes
      within a plant

      ### Manual Transfer Overhead Conveyor Systems


      The NikoTrack manual overhead monorail conveyors are designed to handle
      transfer of working loads of up to 3,520 lbs (1600 KGs) using enclosed
      monorail track systems. Loads are easily and smoothly transported through
      transfer devices such as switches, bent track, and turntables to achieve
      infinite possibilities for overhead material handling. NikoTrack overhead
      conveyor monorail tracks and all components are electro galvanized to meet
      tough working environments for both inside and outside work areas. Modular
      in design, the manual overhead conveyor can be changed or extended at a
      later date, should transfer routing requirements change.


      #### Storage Space Utilization


      The use of automatic switches and precision bent 90 degree track, allows
      for a flight bar travelling along the manual overhead conveyor track, to
      be side shifted, and stored in an accumulating idle area for storage or
      process dwell time. The Overhead Conveyor Systems C1 catalogue displays
      the different modular fittings to achieve precise track placement for
      maximum space utilization.


      #### Overhead Load Positioning


      The enclosed precision track has tapered sides to ensure that the load
      carrying trolleys self locate to run freely and smoothly with minimal
      force required to move the loaded trolley. Repeatable positioning of
      loaded trolleys is achieved throughout the entire manual overhead conveyor
      system.


      ### Powered Overhead Conveyor Systems


      NikoTRACK has a unique alternative to the traditionally powered overhead
      conveyor systems. Using localized powered loops, any manual conveyor
      system can have powered travel to move product and flight bars through
      paint booths, ovens, wash systems. Each of these powered loops delivers
      the flight bars to a sideways shifting system of dual track that allows
      for grouping of product to optimize space requirements while awaiting the
      next procedure. Loads up to 3,520 lbs (1600 kgs) per flight bar are easily
      transported by the powered loops. This alternative offers the ability to
      reduce labor content found on traditional overhead monorail conveyor
      lines, that is necessary when a single powered motorized conveyor system
      is used to transfer product through multiple processes in one complete
      loop. By using individual loops for a specific applications, the “lean
      manufacturing cell” approach can be applied to many processes.


      #### NikoTrack Overhead Turntable Detour System


      The unique NikoTrack Turntable Detour system allows for multiple overhead
      track systems to be interconnected. Loads or flight bars are easily
      transferred between different processes or areas of the plant. Turntables
      are an ergonomic solution to multiple conveyor destination systems,
      reducing capital expenditure on more complex overhead conveyor track
      layouts.

      **NikoTrack has 5 main track profiles with a weight capacity of up to
      4,000 lbs. per part.** Each system is custom designed to fit the largest
      part in a finishing system and to efficiently move that part through the
      finishing technology incorporated by your company.


      NikoTrack’s unique approach using automatic switches allows for even long
      parts to maneuver in an efficient manner through a finishing process, as
      well as keeping a compact foot print.


      The modular pre-engineered design enables systems to be easily expandable.
      This flexibility allows for a finishing system to grow with the production
      needs of a business. A system can be retrofitted with a chain drive system
      to accommodate new technologies, like an IR oven or automatic spray booth,
      all with minimal impact on the design and greatly reduced down time for a
      conveyor update.


      The modular flexibility enables other material handling systems like crane
      to be integrated into the finishing process. A part can quickly be moved
      from a welding bay or dip tank onto a finishing line, eliminating the need
      for carts or forklifts to tie up precious floor space.
