      **NikoTrack's** overhead monorail conveyor systems are designed to suit
      most existing working environments. They can be configured as chain
      powered or a low cost alternative to 'power and free' systems for certain
      scenarios such as lean manufacturing systems. Automatic switches allow for
      side shifting on dual tracks to maximize storage space. NikoTracks six
      profiles are capable of carrying loads up to 3,520 lbs. **NikoTrack LLC**
      is a distributor of the Greek company Helm Hellas. Beginning in 1972, Helm
      Hellas originally focused on developing, producing and marketing sliding
      door fittings and overhead conveyor systems, but soon expanded to the
      light weight crane market as well. The **NikoTrack** product consists of a
      range of profile track sections, support fittings and carrier trolleys.
      These components can be assembled to produce a large range of modular
      design products including:


      * Manual Overhead Conveyors

      * Suspension Systems

      * Festoon Cable Supply Systems

      * Industrial Barn Door tracks and fittings

      * Lightweight Overhead Cranes


      NikoTrack produces manual overhead conveyor and monorail transfer systems
      that are modular in design for ease of installation and modification.


      ### Key Features


      * Multiple track sizes

      * Manual or powered

      * Flexible and simple track mounting system

      * Standard components to connect and suspend the monorail conveyor track

      * All components are electro galvanized for complete protection

      * Seamless integration with the NikoTrack lightweight crane and lifting
      equipment

      * Free running, economical with minimal maintenance


      ### Suitable For


      * Powder coating, painting, and material finishing applications

      * Any industrial process that requires movement of parts, above floor
      level

      * Situations where flightbars are used to move parts between processes
      within a plant

      As an alternative to fully powered overhead conveyors, Niko offers a
      semi-automatic alternative. This system utilises any manual conveyor
      system and powers it through ovens, spray booths or any area where manual
      operation is not practical. This solution is far more cost effective than
      using fully automatic conveyors.


      A chain conveyor can be installed parallel to the conveyor carrying the
      load in order to power the movement.  Powered movement can be achieved not
      only in straight lines but also around bends, making it possible to have a
      completely powered system.


      Typical applications would be to power the movement through the ovens or
      painting booths and have the parking areas free in order to load and
      unload the products in adequate time. The benefits of the power chain
      conveyor are its competitive price, quiet operation and the fact that it
      can be added to a manual conveyor at a future stage.

      ### Manual Transfer Overhead Conveyor Systems


      * Working loads of up to 3,250 lbs (1600 Kg)

      * Smooth movement through transfer devices such as:
        * Switches
        * Bends
        * Turntables
      * Modular design

      * Allows infinite design possiblilities

      * Easily updated, changed or modified as required

      * Electro galvanized to meet tough working environments for both inside
      and outside work areas


      #### Storage Space Utilization


      The use of automatic switches and precision bent 90 degree track, allows
      for a flight bar travelling along the manual overhead conveyor track, to
      be side shifted, and stored in an accumulating idle area for storage or
      process dwell time. The Overhead Conveyor Systems C1 catalogue displays
      the different modular fittings to achieve precise track placement for
      maximum space utilization.


      #### Overhead Load Positioning


      The enclosed precision track has tapered sides to ensure that the load
      carrying trolleys self locate to run freely and smoothly with minimal
      force required to move the loaded trolley. Repeatable positioning of
      loaded trolleys is achieved throughout the entire manual overhead conveyor
      system.


      #### NikoTrack Overhead Turntable Detour System


      The unique NikoTrack Turntable Detour system allows for multiple overhead
      track systems to be interconnected. Loads or flight bars are easily
      transferred between different processes or areas of the plant. Turntables
      are an ergonomic solution to multiple conveyor destination systems,
      reducing capital expenditure on more complex overhead conveyor track
      layouts.
