      Freestanding light cranes are generally used when the ceiling is not
      strong enough to support the weight of the crane and the load. The crane
      is supported from a freestanding steel work support structure, which is
      designed and fabricated to suit the requirements of the working area. The
      support structure usually bolts directly to the floor, but can also be
      partially suspended from adjacent walls, stanchions or overhanging beams.


      **Advantages:**


      * Ultra-low headroom

      * Crane bridge does not grab

      * Low-maintenance and long working life

      * Easy to install

      * Fit directly to roof and a wide range of structures

      * For indoor and outdoor applications

      * Ideal for food applications and clean areas

      * Easy to extend, modify or relocate

      * Can connect to other cranes and conveyors

      * Cost effective

  - body: "Ceiling mounted light crane\r\n\nCeiling mounted light cranes are an ideal solution for applications where floor space is at a premium. The light crane can be suspended directly or dropped down from the existing ceiling or building support beams. The Niko C2 range has a wide variety of suspension brackets to enable the light crane to be suspended from virtually any roof structure. The major advantage of this type of system is that the floor space is kept clear of supporting stanchions, enabling free movement underneath the light crane."

      Nikotrack uses a C-track festoon assembly and c-track festoon pendant
      system for overhead cranes and industrial machinery. All festoon trolleys
      can be modified to fit either flat cable or round hose. Our nylon cable
      trolleys are extremely reliable and smooth running. Because of the self
      aligning tapered track, trolleys can never slide out of the center of the
      rail, ensuring a smooth and free operation.
