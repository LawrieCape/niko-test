According to OSHA a fall protection system is designed to arrest or prevent falls from a height. OSHA standards state that any time a worker is at a height of four feet or more, the worker is at risk and needs to be protected. Fall protection must be provided at four feet in general industry, five feet in maritime and six feet in construction. However, regardless of the fall distance, fall protection must be provided when working over dangerous equipment and machinery. The US Department of Labor (DOL) lists falls as one of the leading causes of traumatic occupational death, accounting for eight percent of all occupational fatalities from trauma.\r\n\r\n#### Advantages of Niko Fall Protection Track vs Taut Wire Fall Protection System\r\n\r\n* There is less distance to fall with NikoTrack fall protection track and therefore less impact on the body\r\n* No bouncing effect, which can cause injury on secondary falls\r\n* Multiple person systems are safer with NikoTrack fall protection track.
