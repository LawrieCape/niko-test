      NikoTrack produces manual overhead conveyor and monorail transfer systems
      that are modular in design for ease of installation and modification.


      ### Key Features


      * Multiple track sizes 

      * Manual or powered

      * Flexible and simple track mounting system

      * Standard components to connect and suspend the monorail conveyor track

      * All components are electro galvanized for complete protection

      * Seamless integration with the NikoTrack lightweight crane and lifting
      equipment

      * Free running, economical with minimal maintenance


      ### Suitable For


      * Powder coating, painting, and material finishing applications

      * Any industrial process that requires movement of parts, above floor
      level

      * Situations where flightbars are used to move parts between processes
      within a plant

      **Modular Design**


      * The Niko manual overhead conveyors are designed to suit any existing
      working environment and they can be changed or extended at a later date,
      should production requirements change. The modular nature makes them ideal
      for jobbing powder-coating lines.


      **Environmentally Friendly **


      * These manual overhead conveyors have a low carbon footprint with the
      automated parts using minimal power and the manual parts using none at
      all.


      **Storage Space Utilised **


      * Automatic switches change the manual overhead conveyor from a single
      track to side shifting dual tracks and allow flight bars to be grouped
      together and utilise storage space


      **Accurate, Repeatable Load Positioning**


      * The tapered edges of the Niko profile track ensure that the load
      carrying trolleys run smoothly, meaning accurate, repetitive load
      positioning can be achieved throughout the whole manual overhead conveyor.


      **Integration with Lifting Equipment **


      * The Niko manual overhead conveyor is designed to seamlessly integrate
      with Niko lightweight overhead cranes and lifting equipment through
      latching and transfer devices. This reduces the need for manual lifting
      where an overhead conveyor is loaded and unloaded.

    title: Advantages
  - body: >-
      Localised Powered Travel for Manual Overhead Conveyors


      As an alternative to fully powered overhead conveyors, Niko offers a
      semi-automatic alternative. This system utilises any manual conveyor
      system and powers it through ovens, spray booths or any area where manual
      operation is not practical. This solution is far more cost effective than
      using fully automatic conveyors.


      A chain conveyor can be installed parallel to the conveyor carrying the
      load in order to power the movement.  Powered movement can be achieved not
      only in straight lines but also around bends, making it possible to have a
      completely powered system.


      Typical applications would be to power the movement through the ovens or
      painting booths and have the parking areas free in order to load and
      unload the products in adequate time. The benefits of the power chain
      conveyor are its competitive price, quiet operation and the fact that it
      can be added to a manual conveyor at a future stage.

      ### Manual Transfer Overhead Conveyor Systems


      * Working loads of up to 3,250 lbs (1600 Kg)

      * Smooth movement through transfer devices such as:
        * Switches
        * Bends
        * Turntables
      * Modular design

      * Allows infinite design possiblilities

      * Easily updated, changed or modified as required

      * Electro galvanized to meet tough working environments for both inside
      and outside work areas


      #### Storage Space Utilization


      The use of automatic switches and precision bent 90 degree track, allows
      for a flight bar travelling along the manual overhead conveyor track, to
      be side shifted, and stored in an accumulating idle area for storage or
      process dwell time. The Overhead Conveyor Systems C1 catalogue displays
      the different modular fittings to achieve precise track placement for
      maximum space utilization.


      #### Overhead Load Positioning


      * Track has tapered sides for free, low force, smooth running


      The enclosed precision track has tapered sides to ensure that the load
      carrying trolleys self locate to run freely and smoothly with minimal
      force required to move the loaded trolley. Repeatable positioning of
      loaded trolleys is achieved throughout the entire manual overhead conveyor
      system.


      ### Powered Transfer Overhead Conveyor Systems


      * Unique localized powered loops


      NikoTrack has a unique alternative to the traditionally powered overhead
      conveyor systems. Using localized powered loops, any manual conveyor
      system can have powered travel to move product and flight bars through
      paint booths, ovens, wash systems. Each of these powered loops delivers
      the flight bars to a sideways shifting system of dual track that allows
      for grouping of product to optimize space requirements while awaiting the
      next procedure. Loads up to 3,520 lbs (1600 kgs) per flight bar are easily
      transported by the powered loops. This alternative offers the ability to
      reduce labor content found on traditional overhead monorail conveyor
      lines, that is necessary when a single powered motorized conveyor system
      is used to transfer product through multiple processes in one complete
      loop. By using individual loops for a specific applications, the “lean
      manufacturing cell” approach can be applied to many processes.


      #### NikoTrack Overhead Turntable Detour System


      The unique NikoTrack Turntable Detour system allows for multiple overhead
      track systems to be interconnected. Loads or flight bars are easily
      transferred between different processes or areas of the plant. Turntables
      are an ergonomic solution to multiple conveyor destination systems,
      reducing capital expenditure on more complex overhead conveyor track
      layouts.
