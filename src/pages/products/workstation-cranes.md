      Niko C2 light cranes are the ideal solution for lightweight lifting of
      load capacities up to 2000kg. They are supplied in a modular kit form,
      which enables them to be easily assembled, modified or moved to
      accommodate changes in your working patterns. The construction of Niko C2
      light cranes is considerably lighter, free-running and more versatile than
      conventional I-beam overhead cranes.

      Freestanding light cranes are generally used when the ceiling is not
      strong enough to support the weight of the crane and the load. The crane
      is supported from a freestanding steelwork support structure, which is
      designed and fabricated to suit the requirements of the working area. The
      support structure usually bolts directly to the floor, but can also be
      partially suspended from adjacent walls, stanchions or overhanging beams.


      NikoTrack crane enables the user an easy, fast and ergonomic movement of
      the material downshop and across a span. Manual bridge cranes operate
      faster than motorized systems, the latter is used where accessibility is
      restricted. NikoTrack has a tapered track that automatically guides the
      trolley to the center of the track, moving the heaviest loads only
      requires a fraction of force to begin movement and even less to maintain
      it. There is a 100/1 weight to force ratio, so to move a
      1,000<sup>lbs</sup> of material only requires 10 lbs of force to start
      moving it and only 8 lbs to continue moving. Also, with the NikoTracks
      inverted tapered track profile, there is a much less likelihood of
      dirt/dust accumulating inside of the track which will require less
      maintenance and ensure reliability.


      NikoTrack has a full range of track, track joints, support brackets,
      I-beam connectors and end carriage trolleys. All designed for ease of
      design and installation. All fittings are zinc plate for maximum
      durability and protection for tough operating environments. **Tracks** are
      available in 6 meter length ( 19.70 feet), they are cold rolled with
      tapered sides designed to center the trolleys, prevent dust build up
      assuring smooth transfer of trolleys. The end carriage trolleys are fitted
      with horizontal guide rollers, connecting the moving cross bridge member
      to the down shop tracks.

      Ceiling mounted light cranes are an ideal solution for applications where
      floor space is at a premium. The light crane can be suspended directly or
      dropped down from the existing ceiling or building support beams. The Niko
      C2 range has a wide variety of suspension brackets to enable the light
      crane to be suspended from virtually any roof structure. The major
      advantage of this type of system is that the floor space is kept clear of
      supporting stanchions, enabling free movement underneath the light crane.


      **NOTE:** The roof support points must be tested and approved by a
      structural engineer to ensure they can sustain the weight of the load and
      light crane.

All festoon trolleys can be modified to fit either flat cable or round hose. Our nylon cable trolleys are extremely reliable and smooth running. Because of the self aligning tapered track, trolleys can never slide out of the center of the rail, ensuring a smooth and free operation."
