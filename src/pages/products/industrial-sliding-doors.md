NikoTrack industrial sliding door track and all components are electro galvanized to meet tough working environments for both inside and outside work areas. The NikoTrack has a tapered track that automatically guides the trolley to the center of the track, moving the heaviest loads only requires a fraction of force to begin movement and even less to maintain it. There is a 100/1 weight to force ratio, so to move a 1,000 lbs of material only requires 10 lbs of force to start moving it and only 8 lbs to continue moving. Also, the NikoTracks inverted tapered track profile, there is a much less likelihood of dirt/dust/snow/ice accumulating inside of the track which will require less maintenance and ensure reliability. All fittings are zinc plate for maximum durability and protection for tough operating environments. Tracks are available in 6 meter length (19.70 feet), they are cold rolled with tapered sides designed to center the trolleys, prevent dust build up assuring smooth transfer of trolleys.[![NikoTrack Track Series Profiles](http://nikotrack.com/slidingdoors/files/2012/11/Track-Profiles-300x265.jpg)](http://nikotrack.com/slidingdoors/files/2012/11/Track-Profiles.jpg)</div>"
