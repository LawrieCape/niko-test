  - body: "## NikoTrack Overhead Conveyor and Monorail Systems at a Glance\r\n\r\nNikoTRACK produces manual overhead conveyor and monorail transfer systems that are modular in design for ease of installation and modification.\r\n\r\n* Multiple track sizes for wide range of load\r\n* Flexible track mounting systems for simple installation\r\n* Standard components to connect and suspend the monorail conveyor track\r\n* All track, switches and components are electro galvanized for complete protection in interior and exterior apps\r\n* The manual overhead conveyor can be seamlessly integrated with the NikoTrack lightweight crane and lifting equipment, via automatic manual latching devices. This degree of integration allows flight bars to move from processes such as dipping, paint finish lines to an overhead monorail to efficiently transfer to another process or area within the plant\r\n* Free running, economical with minimal maintenance\r\n* NikoTrack manual conveyors are ideal for powder coating, painting, and material finishing applications."

Loads are easily and smoothly transported through transfer devices such as switches, bent track, and turntables to achieve infinite possibilities for overhead material handling. NikoTrack overhead conveyor monorail tracks and all components are electro galvanized to meet tough working environments for both inside and outside work areas. Modular in design, the manual overhead conveyor can be changed or extended at a later date, should transfer routing requirements change.\r\n\r\n#### Storage Space Utilization\r\n\r\nThe use of automatic switches and precision bent 90 degree track, allows for a flight bar travelling along the manual overhead conveyor track, to be side shifted, and stored in an accumulating idle area for storage or process dwell time. The Overhead Conveyor Systems C1 catalogue displays the different modular fittings to achieve precise track placement for maximum space utilization.\r\n\r\n#### Overhead Load Positioning\r\n\r\nThe enclosed precision track has tapered sides to ensure that the load carrying trolleys self locate to run freely and smoothly with minimal force required to move the loaded trolley. Repeatable positioning of loaded trolleys is achieved throughout the entire manual overhead conveyor system.</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"column grid_6 last\">\r\n\r\n### Powered Overhead Conveyor Systems\r\n\r\nNikoTRACK has a unique alternative to the traditionally powered overhead conveyor systems. Using localized powered loops, any manual conveyor system can have powered travel to move product and flight bars through paint booths, ovens, wash systems. Each of these powered loops delivers the flight bars to a sideways shifting system of dual track that allows for grouping of product to optimize space requirements while awaiting the next procedure. Loads up to 3,520 lbs (1600 kgs) per flight bar are easily transported by the powered loops. This alternative offers the ability to reduce labor content found on traditional overhead monorail conveyor lines, that is necessary when a single powered motorized conveyor system is used to transfer product through multiple processes in one complete loop. By using individual loops for a specific applications, the “lean manufacturing cell” approach can be applied to many processes.\r\n\r\n#### NikoTrack Overhead Turntable Detour System\r\n\r\nThe unique NikoTrack Turntable Detour system allows for multiple overhead track systems to be interconnected. Loads or flight bars are easily transferred between different processes or areas of the plant. ![.A43 multiple turntable switch with 2 bends on conveyors](http://nikotrack.com/overheadconveyors/files/2012/11/A43-lg-e1355344701351.jpg \".A43 multiple turntable switch with 2 bends on conveyors\")Turntables are an ergonomic solution to multiple conveyor destination systems, reducing capital expenditure on more complex overhead conveyor track layouts.</div>"

      **NikoTrack has 5 main track profiles with a weight capacity of up to
      4,000 lbs. per part.** Each system is custom designed to fit the largest
      part in a finishing system and to efficiently move that part through the
      finishing technology incorporated by your company. 


      NikoTrack’s unique approach using automatic switches allows for even long
      parts to maneuver in an efficient manner through a finishing process, as
      well as keeping a compact foot print. 


      The modular pre-engineered design enables systems to be easily expandable.
      This flexibility allows for a finishing system to grow with the production
      needs of a business. A system can be retrofitted with a chain drive system
      to accommodate new technologies, like an IR oven or automatic spray booth,
      all with minimal impact on the design and greatly reduced down time for a
      conveyor update. 


      The modular flexibility enables other material handling systems like crane
      to be integrated into the finishing process. A part can quickly be moved
      from a welding bay or dip tank onto a finishing line, eliminating the need
      for carts or forklifts to tie up precious floor space.
