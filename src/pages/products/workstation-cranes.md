      Niko C2 light cranes are the ideal solution for lightweight lifting of
      load capacities up to 2000kg. They are supplied in a modular kit form,
      which enables them to be easily assembled, modified or moved to
      accommodate changes in your working patterns. The construction of Niko C2
      light cranes is considerably lighter, free-running and more versatile than
      conventional I-beam overhead cranes.


      * Lift loads up to 2000kg

      * Bridge span up to 12m

      * Smooth and easy movement in all directions

      * Manual or electronic lifting and travel

      * Robust construction

      * Wide range of fixing brackets

      * Zinc plated, powder coated, hot dip galvanised finish

      * Available in Stainless steel

      * Modular design

      Ceiling mounted light cranes are an ideal solution for applications where
      floor space is at a premium. The light crane can be suspended directly or
      dropped down from the existing ceiling or building support beams. The Niko
      C2 range has a wide variety of suspension brackets to enable the light
      crane to be suspended from virtually any roof structure. The major
      advantage of this type of system is that the floor space is kept clear of
      supporting stanchions, enabling free movement underneath the light crane.

  - body: "**Layout Types\r**\n\nLight cranes usually comprise of 2 runway tracks running parallel with a bridge suspended below. The bridge enables a chain hoist or alternative lifting device to be suspended and travel from side to side along the bridge. The bridge can be travelled forwards and backwards along the runway tracks. This enables to operator to lift, move and lower a load anywhere within the working footprint below the light crane.\r\n\n\rIt is possible to have multiple light crane bridges suspended from the same runway tracks.\r\n\n**\rSingle Girder Light Cranes**\n\n![single girder light crane](/img/single_girder_21.jpg)\n\nSingle girder light cranes feature a single track bridge rail. This is the most common type of light crane system. The main advantage of single girder light cranes is that they offer the widest travel distance along the bridge and across the runway tracks.\r\n\n\r\n\n**Double Girder Light Cranes**\n\n![double girder light crane](/img/double_girder_light_crane.jpg)\n\nDouble girder light cranes feature a twin track bridge rail with the hoist suspended so that the weight of the load is carried evenly across both rails. The main advantage of double girder light cranes is that they offer a wider span between the runways than a single girder equivalent. It is also possible to add an intermediate runway beam and enable an even longer bridge length.\n\n**Low-headroom Light Cranes**\n\n![low headroom light crane](/img/low_headroom_1.jpg)\n\nLow-headroom light cranes feature a double girder bridge with a raised suspension section for mounting the hoist or alterative lifting device. The Niko product offers the lowest available headroom solution on the market. As a standard, the hoist is suspended within 100mm of the crane support point and in some instances even less. The main advantage of Low-headroom light cranes is that they provide a lifting solution in confined spaces where overhead lifting would not normally be possible.\r\n\n**\rMonorails\r**\n\n\rMonorails feature an independent track rail with a trolley that can be used to suspend a hoist or alternative lifting device. The hoist can then travel forward and back along the full length of the rail. Monorails consist of an assembly of straight track sections, curved track bends, junction switches and turn tables. The junction switches and turn table enable a change in direction, allowing the hoist trolley to follow different travel paths.\n\n**Light Crane Latching Systems**\n\n![light crane latching system](/img/latching.jpg)\n\nLatching systems interlock with the bridge of a light crane and enable the hoist trolley to be used on an adjacent monorail or another light crane system. It is possible to combine multiple latching devices within a single light crane system. The main advantage of latching systems is that they enable the use of the hoist or alternative lifting device outside of the normal working footprint of a light crane.\r\n\n**\rSliding Cantilever Beams**\n\n![sliding cantilever beam cranes](/img/sliding_cantilever.jpg)\n\nSliding cantilever beams are used to enable lifting outside of the normal working footprint of a light crane or monorail system. They feature an under-slung cantilever section suspended from a light crane bridge, monorail track or crane runway rails. The cantilever section can then travel past the confines of the suspending rail and enable lifting outside of the normal lifting footprint. This type of system is the ideal solution for lifting and moving a load in and out of containers; or for cranes that need to avoid obstacles within the working area."

      Freestanding light cranes are generally used when the ceiling is not
      strong enough to support the weight of the crane and the load. The crane
      is supported from a freestanding steel work support structure, which is
      designed and fabricated to suit the requirements of the working area. The
      support structure usually bolts directly to the floor, but can also be
      partially suspended from adjacent walls, stanchions or overhanging beams.


      **Advantages:**


      * Ultra-low headroom

      * Crane bridge does not grab

      * Low-maintenance and long working life

      * Easy to install

      * Fit directly to roof and a wide range of structures

      * For indoor and outdoor applications

      * Ideal for food applications and clean areas

      * Easy to extend, modify or relocate

      * Can connect to other cranes and conveyors

      * Cost effective

      Nikotrack uses a C-track festoon assembly and c-track festoon pendant
      system for overhead cranes and industrial machinery. All festoon trolleys
      can be modified to fit either flat cable or round hose. Our nylon cable
      trolleys are extremely reliable and smooth running. Because of the self
      aligning tapered track, trolleys can never slide out of the center of the
      rail, ensuring a smooth and free operation.
