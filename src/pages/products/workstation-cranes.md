A ceiling mounted crane will provide maximum coverage of an area without interfering with existing support columns, while a stand-alone system can be installed without being confined to the structure of the building. Also, either system can be linked to a monorail conveyor system or even another crane using our Track Transfer Assembly.\r\n"
