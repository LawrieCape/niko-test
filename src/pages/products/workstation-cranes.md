  - body: "### Ceiling Mounted Bridge Cranes\r\n\r\nCeiling mounted and stand-alone overhead cranes proved a cost effective and efficient solution to your material handling issues. A ceiling mounted crane will provide maximum coverage of an area without interfering with existing support columns, while a stand-alone system can be installed without being confined to the structure of the building. Also, either system can be linked to a monorail conveyor system or even another crane using our Track Transfer Assembly.\r\n"

      ### Freestanding Bridge Cranes


      NikoTrack crane enables the user an easy, fast and ergonomic movement of
      the material downshop and across a span. Manual bridge cranes operate
      faster than motorized systems, the latter is used where accessibility is
      restricted. NikoTrack has a tapered track that automatically guides the
      trolley to the center of the track, moving the heaviest loads only
      requires a fraction of force to begin movement and even less to maintain
      it. There is a 100/1 weight to force ratio, so to move a
      1,000<sup>lbs</sup> of material only requires 10 lbs of force to start
      moving it and only 8 lbs to continue moving. Also, with the NikoTracks
      inverted tapered track profile, there is a much less likelihood of
      dirt/dust accumulating inside of the track which will require less
      maintenance and ensure reliability.


      NikoTrack has a full range of track, track joints, support brackets,
      I-beam connectors and end carriage trolleys. All designed for ease of
      design and installation. All fittings are zinc plate for maximum
      durability and protection for tough operating environments. **Tracks** are
      available in 6 meter length ( 19.70 feet), they are cold rolled with
      tapered sides designed to center the trolleys, prevent dust build up
      assuring smooth transfer of trolleys. The end carriage trolleys are fitted
      with horizontal guide rollers, connecting the moving cross bridge member
      to the down shop tracks.

  - body: "### Festoon Cable System\r\n\r\nNikotrack uses a C-track **festoon assembly** and **c-track festoon pendant system** for **overhead cranes** and industrial machinery. All festoon trolleys can be modified to fit either flat cable or round hose. Our nylon cable trolleys are extremely reliable and smooth running. Because of the self aligning tapered track, trolleys can never slide out of the center of the rail, ensuring a smooth and free operation."
