      **NikoTrack's** overhead monorail conveyor systems are designed to suit
      most existing working environments. They can be configured as chain
      powered or a low cost alternative to 'power and free' systems for certain
      scenarios such as lean manufacturing systems. Automatic switches allow for
      side shifting on dual tracks to maximize storage space. NikoTracks six
      profiles are capable of carrying loads up to 3,520 lbs.

      **NikoTrack** provides a complete range of track sections, support
      fittings, trolleys, turns and switches. These components can be assembled
      to produce a large range of modular design products including:


      * Manual Overhead Conveyors

      * Suspension Systems

      * Festoon Cable Supply Systems

      * Industrial Barn Door tracks and fittings

      * Lightweight Overhead Cranes


      NikoTrack produces manual overhead conveyor and monorail transfer systems
      that are modular in design for ease of installation and modification.

      As an alternative to fully powered overhead conveyors, Niko offers a
      semi-automatic alternative. This system utilises any manual conveyor
      system and powers it through ovens, spray booths or any area where manual
      operation is not practical. This solution is far more cost effective than
      using fully automatic conveyors.


      A chain conveyor can be installed parallel to the conveyor carrying the
      load in order to power the movement.  Powered movement can be achieved not
      only in straight lines but also around bends, making it possible to have a
      completely powered system.


      Typical applications would be to power the movement through the ovens or
      painting booths and have the parking areas free in order to load and
      unload the products in adequate time. The benefits of the power chain
      conveyor are its competitive price, quiet operation and the fact that it
      can be added to a manual conveyor at a future stage.

  - body: "There are an infinite number of possible track layouts, to suit any particular application. Nikotrack provide a wide range of turns, switches, turntables, which can be manually or pneumatically operated. Layouts can be optimized for:\n\n* **Storage Space Utilization\r**\n  * The use of automatic switches and precision bent 90 degree track, allows for a flight bar travelling along the manual overhead conveyor track, to be side shifted, and stored in an accumulating idle area for storage or process dwell time. The Overhead Conveyor Systems C1 catalogue displays the different modular fittings to achieve precise track placement for maximum space utilization.\r\n* **Overhead Load Positioning\r**\n  * The enclosed precision track has tapered sides to ensure that the load carrying trolleys self locate to run freely and smoothly with minimal force required to move the loaded trolley. Repeatable positioning of loaded trolleys is achieved throughout the entire manual overhead conveyor system.\r\n* **NikoTrack Overhead Turntable Detour System\r**\n  * The unique NikoTrack Turntable Detour system allows for multiple overhead track systems to be interconnected. Loads or flight bars are easily transferred between different processes or areas of the plant. Turntables are an ergonomic solution to multiple conveyor destination systems, reducing capital expenditure on more complex overhead conveyor track layouts."
